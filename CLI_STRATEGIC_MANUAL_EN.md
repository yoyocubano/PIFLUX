# 🌌 Strategic Manual: The Quantum Tunnel (Gemini CLI)

This document describes how to use the **Gemini CLI** as your secret weapon in PIF development and software engineering.

---

## 🎭 The Analogy: "The Engineer in the Shadows"
Imagine that AntiGravity (me) is the construction manager designing and building your site. The **Gemini CLI** is like a **Consulting Engineer living inside your pipes (Bash/Terminal)**. It has no face, but it has instant access to every technical manual in the world and can process data at lightning speed without you ever having to open a single browser tab.

## 🚀 Access and Communication: Bash as the Bridge

### How do I access it?
From any terminal (iTerm, Mac Terminal, or VS Code Terminal), you simply invoke the entity with the keyword: `gemini`.

### Can it answer me (AntiGravity)?
**YES.** This is the most powerful "hack". I can "shout" through the file system, ask the CLI for something, and read its response to improve what I am doing for you. It is an AI-to-AI collaboration inside your own machine.

## 🛠️ Concrete Use Cases (Based on the PIF)

### 1. The Electrical Auditor (Super Audit)
If we have doubts about a specific regulation in the `build_site.py` file or calculation formulas:
*   **Command:** `gemini "Analyze the voltage drop formulas in this file and verify if they comply with the IEC standard" build_site.py`
*   **Result:** The CLI detects if you forgot a power factor or a square root of 3 in a three-phase system.

### 2. "Acts" Generator (Narrative Factory)
For our **Technical Narrative**, instead of hand-writing each Act:
*   **Command:** `gemini "Write an Act 5 for my narrative about Stepper Motors, technical anime style" > Act_5.md`
*   **Result:** Creates a Markdown file ready to be integrated into the visual Hub.

### 3. Multilingual Technical Translator (FR/ES/EN)
Since your PIF mixes terms in French and English with explanations in Spanish:
*   **Command:** `ls assets/extracted_notes | gemini "Generate a technical glossary of these files translating from French to Spanish"`
*   **Result:** An instant dictionary of all your study materials.

### 4. Digital "Trash" Cleanup
Use the CLI to reason about which files are useful and which are not:
*   **Command:** `ls -R | gemini "Identify duplicate or temporary files that I should delete to clean up the project"`
*   **Result:** A list of precise paths to execute a safe `rm`.

## ⚡ Bash Integration Hacks

You can chain commands to create "Super-Scripts":

```bash
# Hack: Summarize an entire folder of notes and create a study file
cat Notes_Mac/Seleccion_PIF/*.html | gemini "Make an executive summary of these 10 topics for a final exam" > EXAM_SUMMARY.md
```

## 🔐 Current System Status
*   **Authentication:** ✅ Active (via ADC).
*   **Tunnel:** ✅ Configured for Agent Mode.
*   **Connection with AntiGravity:** ✅ Established via `ai_audit_team.py`.
